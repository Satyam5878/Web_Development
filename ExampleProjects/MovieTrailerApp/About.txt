M.E.A.N app:
    M MongoDB
    E ExpressJS
    A AngularJS
    N NodeJS

About App:
    Movie trailer app

    Angulajs front end, consumes apis in the backend
    full crud capabilites
    total seperation between api server and angularJS Front end

Prerequisite:
    Homebrew:
    NodeJS:
    MongoDb:
    GruntCLI: for automating things, less compiling etc
    Bower:

API first:
    create the api on the server first and relation between them first and then build the intefaces arou it


Setting up project(NodeJS):
    create server directory
    and npm init
    
    downloading modules:
        npm install --save express
        npm install --save mongoosh
        npm install --save node-restful
        npm install --save method-override
        npm install --save body-parser
        npm install --save loadash
    Writing bootstrap file:
        loaded module
        created app
        used middleware required for REST API's
        connected to mongodb database
        created server and listen to port 3000
        
        for REST API's add more middle ware: CORS Support for restfull interfaces
        app.use: for content routes
        
        
        (express: nodejs web application framework)
        
    Creating a Model:
        define schema in mongodb
        index of a model
        
        
        dependency injection, dependency inject into the controller,
        controller to have access to all the model, but model do not have to know about the controller
    Creating the controller:
        node-restful: takes the model and create the restful api, i.e. all the CRUD operations, model defins the restful apis
        
    Creating the routes:
        it assigns the controller to the given routes
        create the routes and assign controllers
        registering the routes
        
    Building a client:
        AngularJS: Single page application, but looks like full featured app
        Bootstrapping(scaffolding) the client with yeoman
        
        npm install -g yo
        npm install - generator-angular
        Yeoman docs- http://yeoman.io/learning/
